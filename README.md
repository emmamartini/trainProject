Hi!

First time you are running this application run Main.py
This will create your database, and download tables necessary for the program to run.

To use the user application, run the userApplication.py file.

To send messages, run the get_subscription.py file.

The database is managed using SQLite. To see the visuals, go to the DB Browser file.
